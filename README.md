# Data Structures implementation in Python3.
Linked List, Stack and Queue implemented in Python3. All the methods of the classes listed below were tested using unit tests.
## Linked list
**Node:**
- get_value:  return the value
- get_next:  return the next node
- set_next:  set the next node

**myLinkedList:**
- add_first:  adding an element at the front
- add_last:  adding an element at the end
- remove_first:  removing a node at the front
- list_traversal:  every node in the list has been seem

**myStack**
- push: adds an element to the stack
- peek: returns the last added element but does not remove it
- pop: removes the most recent element added 

**myQueue**
- enqueue: adds an element to the rear of the queue
- peek: returns the front most element from the queue but  does not remove it
- dequeue: returns and removes the front most element from the queue
- isEmpty: checks if queue is empty
